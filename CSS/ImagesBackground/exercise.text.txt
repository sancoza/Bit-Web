Size
● Find an image with a wide aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9, 21:9...)
● Include that image three times on the page
● Each image should be in a separate row
● The first image should be 200px high
● The second image should be 200px wide
● The third image should be 200px wide and 200px high

Aligning
● Modify the previously example
● Align the first image to the right
● Align the second image in the center
● Align the third one to the left

Background
● Create a page with a main title
● Add a couple of subheadings
● After each subheading, add a single paragraph with some text
● The page should be long enough for the scrollbar to appear
Repeat
● Find an image that can be included as a repeating image on the
page
● Use that image to set a background image on the body element
Attachment

● Modify the previous example
● Prevent image from moving while the user scrolls down the
page
Position
● Use the previous code structure
● Remove previously defined styles for the background image
● Add a new background image. It shouldn’t be repeated
● Image should be horizontally positioned on the right
● The image should be positioned vertically in the body center
● Make it fixed
Size

● However, the image should not be deformed (aspect ratio has
to be preserved)
